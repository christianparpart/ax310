# Coverage.cmake - Clang source-based code coverage.
#
# Options:
#   ENABLE_COVERAGE - Instrument every first-party target and offer the report
#                     targets below. OFF by default; the `clang-coverage` preset
#                     turns it on.
#
# Targets:
#   coverage        - Run the whole CTest suite under instrumentation and render
#                     the report (HTML, lcov, and a machine-readable summary).
#   coverage-clean  - Drop the report and every raw profile.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake --preset clang-coverage
#   cmake --build --preset clang-coverage
#   cmake --build --preset clang-coverage --target coverage
#
# Source-based coverage rather than gcov, and the reason is the shape of this
# suite rather than a preference. `catch_discover_tests` gives every one of the
# TEST_CASEs its own process -- 132 of them across two binaries -- and CI runs
# them in parallel. gcov merges its counters into a shared .gcda per object
# file as each process exits, so concurrent writers race -- which is what the
# `--ignore-errors mismatch,inconsistent` in every lcov invocation on the
# internet is papering over, and a suppressed error there means under-counted
# coverage reported as a clean run. LLVM's runtime keys the raw profile on the
# binary's own module signature and merges into it under a lock, so the same
# suite needs no suppression and no serialization. It also means no lcov and no
# genhtml: `llvm-cov show` renders the HTML itself.

# Gated here for the same reason as the two above rather than left to fail in
# the script: scripts/coverage.sh reads the percentage out of llvm-cov's JSON
# summary with it, at the very end, so a missing interpreter would otherwise
# surface only after the entire suite, the merge and both exports had run.
#
# So the interpreter is located by something that RUNS it. `find_program(NAMES
# python3)` returns the first name match on PATH and never executes it, which
# makes the gate above test the wrong property -- not "is there a python3" but
# "is there one that runs" -- and an unrunnable path then reaches the `coverage`
# target and fails at the end of the run, which is the exact outcome the
# paragraph above says this gate prevents. Reproduced on Linux against a
# `python3` that cannot exec: the old spelling baked it in and configure
# SUCCEEDED. `find_package(Python3 COMPONENTS Interpreter)` validates by running
# the interpreter, so here that failure becomes a configure-time refusal.
#
# The two `find_program` calls above obey the same rule the long way -- each runs
# `--version` and refuses on a mismatch -- because there is no `find_package` for
# llvm-profdata. For Python there is one, so the call IS the obedience. It does
# NOT follow that every `find_program` in this tree is wrong: one that runs before
# `project()` has no toolchain for `find_package` to stand on, and must use
# `find_program` whatever the rule says.
#
# Nor is the Windows alias that makes the rule sharp reachable here: `ENABLE_COVERAGE`
# refuses WIN32 about 140 lines above. What IS reachable on this file's platforms is
# any `python3` found by name that cannot run -- a dangling symlink, a venv shim
# whose interpreter was removed, a wrapper naming an uninstalled toolchain.
#
# And what the swap buys on those platforms is VALIDATION, not a better search:
# measured, FindPython stops at the first name match and does not go on to a working
# interpreter later on PATH. So this trades a late failure for an early one, which is
# the trade the gate above exists to make -- and the refusal has to name
# `-DPython3_EXECUTABLE=`, or it strands somebody who does have an interpreter.
#
# QUIET plus an explicit check rather than REQUIRED, so the diagnostic below
# survives.
#
# WHERE ELSE PYTHON IS LOCATED, because #568 is a two-authors-of-one-fact problem
# and its next failure is a third author arriving quietly. Four sites; the
# acceptance clause allows a differing one that says why:
#
#   cmake/Coverage.cmake             find_package  -- validates
#   src/tests/CMakeLists.txt         find_package  -- validates
#   scripts/tidy-sweep.sh            command -v    -- does not
#   scripts/launcher-replay-e2e.sh   command -v    -- does not
#
# Named by file and by call, never by line: a line number in a comment goes false
# silently. The two shell fixtures differ for a reason rather than by accident --
# shell has no validating equivalent, and both run only under bash on the POSIX
# legs. Nothing ENFORCES this set (#607), so it is four names and not a claim that
# they are the only ones.
#
# `scripts/coverage.sh` is where python is used and locates none: it is handed
# `--python3` from here. One lookup, passed down, is the shape to keep.
# `PYTHON3_PATH` is retired by #568 and read by nothing. ABOVE the lookup, not
# below it: the operator who set it did so BECAUSE PATH had no usable python3, so
# below the refusal they hit the fatal and never learn the flag is dead or what
# replaced it -- the one migration this block exists for is the one it missed. Unset so that residue in
# an existing build tree warns once and is gone, while a `-D` somebody is still
# passing warns every time -- which separates habit from leftover without having
# to tell them apart. WARNING and not FATAL_ERROR, because inert residue must not
# break the re-configure of a tree that was fine; and not `message(DEPRECATION)`,
# the obvious CMake-native answer, because that is silenced by
# `-Wno-deprecated` and this exists to stop a setting being believed in silence.
